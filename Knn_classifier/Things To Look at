We implemented a very slow version of the KNN- classifier
Our version seems very close to the version shown oon the course site.

need to look at implementations using cdist that simontenously compute the distance for several test points efficently.

need to look at other implementations (sklearn for example and understand how to improve speed)

according to the site one should test for hyper parameters on a val set of data before testing on the test set
you can cross-validate by changing which part of the train-data is taken as the val set.

need to add readme
